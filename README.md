# PRODIGYINFOTECH_ML_03
This project focuses on building an image classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The project utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction method to represent the images and trains an SVM model to perform the classification task.

# Image Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project focuses on building an image classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The project utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction method to represent the images and trains an SVM model to perform the classification task.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or later)
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- scikit-image (`scikit-image`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-svm.git
   cd image-classification-svm
   
## Usage
- Download and extract the dataset.

- Organize your dataset with 'train' subdirectories: 'cat' and 'dog'.

- Update training_path in train_svm.py to dataset's 'train' directory.

Train the SVM model
